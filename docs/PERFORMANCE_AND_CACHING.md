# Performance and Caching

This document summarizes active performance and cache behavior that should be maintained.

## Goals

- Keep UI interactions near-instant for cart/wishlist/order surfaces.
- Minimize duplicate CloudBase/Tencent API calls.
- Preserve correctness under refresh, tab switching, and multi-device use.
- Keep storefront **LCP** low on mobile (vendor subdomains and custom domains).

## Image delivery (LCP)

- CloudBase/Tencent Storage public URLs are rewritten to the **render/image** endpoint with sensible defaults:
  - Grid/product cards: **480px** (`gridDisplayImageUrl`)
  - Header logos: **128px** (`logoDisplayImageUrl`)
  - Hero banners: **960px** (`bannerDisplayImageUrl`)
- Override all sizes with `VITE_CLOUDBASE_THUMB_MAX` in env (requires Storage image transformations on your CloudBase/COS plan).
- First four product cards per grid use `priority` on `LazyImage` / `ProductCard` for faster above-the-fold paint.
- Banner slides use `<img fetchPriority="high">` instead of CSS `background-image`.

## Deploy cache refresh (EdgeOne)

Each production build writes a unique `buildId` to `dist/version.json` (via `vite.config.ts`).

| Mechanism | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `bootstrapDeployVersionFromBundle()` | On app boot, compares bundled `VITE_BUILD_ID` to stored version |
| `startDeployVersionWatcher()` | Polls `/version.json` every **2 minutes** + on tab focus/visibility |
| `applyDeployUpdateIfNeeded()` | Purges catalog/admin caches, unregisters SW, hard-reloads **once** per deploy |
| Preserved session keys | Auth tokens, in-flight KBZPay pending order, summary storefront origin |

Configure CDN so `/index.html` and `/version.json` are **no-cache** (`public/_headers`). Hashed `/assets/*` can stay long-lived.

Files: `src/app/utils/deployVersion.ts`, `src/app/App.tsx` (watcher bootstrap).

## Storefront scroll restore

When a customer opens a product from the vendor grid and goes back (browser Back or header back), the grid restores the previous scroll position and category tab.

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `vendorBrowseScroll.ts` | Saves/restores window + container scroll; patches `history.state` |
| `persistedSessionCache.ts` | SessionStorage fallback if history state is lost on remount |
| `ScrollController.tsx` | Skips global scroll-to-top between product list and product detail routes |
| `ProductCard.tsx` | `data-vendor-product-id` anchor for retry scroll-into-view |

Frontend-only — deploy **`dist/`** to EdgeOne after changes (no function zip).

## Vendor catalog caching

- Vendor product pages are fetched with server pagination and optional **category** filter (`VendorStoreView` → `fetchVendorProducts`).
- Cache keys include vendor id, page, search query, category, and page size — category tab changes must refetch, not only filter the first loaded page in memory.
- Persisted localStorage slices are keyed per vendor + category where applicable.

## Frontend load

- Google Fonts load **non-blocking** from `index.html` (reduced weight families).
- `react-quill` CSS is imported only inside `RichTextEditor` (admin), not on every storefront route.
- `index.html` preconnects to CloudBase/Tencent for faster API and image fetches.

## Current implemented patterns

### Cart and wishlist persistence

- Immediate local state + localStorage updates on mutation.
- Immediate server sync for critical mutations (including destructive actions).
- Keepalive usage for reliability during page transitions.
- Realtime/event-based refresh paths for cross-tab/device consistency.

### API usage controls

- Cache freshness checks before forced refetch.
- Session-based throttling for expensive maintenance calls.
- Ambient throttles for profile and background refresh operations.
- Shared fetch/caching helpers to reduce repeated calls.

### Error handling

- Network and timeout failures surface as explicit typed API errors.
- Fail-closed behavior for sensitive validations (example: SKU uniqueness checks).

## Engineering guardrails

When changing data-fetching behavior:
1. Avoid introducing aggressive polling loops (checkout KPay poll is a known exception — keep Realtime primary).
2. Prefer event-driven invalidation over periodic hard refetch.
3. Keep cache invalidation scoped to affected entities.
4. Confirm behavior with immediate refresh and multi-tab checks.

**Known polling exceptions:**

| Surface | Interval | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| KPay checkout | ~1.5s | Fallback while waiting for webhook/Realtime |
| Settings → Activities | 30s | Incremental `GET /auth/staff-activities?since=` while tab is open; session cache on tab switch |
| Deploy version | 2 min + focus | `GET /version.json` — triggers one hard reload after EdgeOne deploy |

Activities cache key: `ADMIN_STAFF_ACTIVITIES` (`module-cache.ts`). Invalidate on vendor approve/delete via `invalidateStaffActivitiesCache()`.

**Scrollbars:** Global thin styling in `theme.css` (`scrollbar-thin`, `scrollbar-thin-x` for horizontal admin tables).

## Realtime and scale (current system)

Every browser tab mounts `OrderRealtimeBridge`, which subscribes to **pulse tables** (`app_order_pulse`, `app_kv_domain_pulse`, `app_vendor_application_pulse`) rather than broadcasting every KV row. Domain pulses are debounced (~400ms) before cache invalidation or admin refetch. A legacy full-KV subscription activates only if the pulse channel fails.

Checkout still uses a **filtered** `kpay_txn:{orderId}` channel. Vendor storefront tabs may listen for product/policy changes in `VendorStoreView`.

| CloudBase/Tencent Pro limit | Included | Impact on this app |
|--------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Realtime peak connections | 500 | ~500 open tabs across all users before throttling |
| Realtime messages / month | 5M | Pulse model reduces fanout vs. global KV; monitor during flash sales |
| Edge Function invocations | 2M/mo | Client cache + SQL read RPCs reduce repeat scans |
| Auth MAU | 100k | Guest browsers **do not** count; only signed-in accounts |

Before high-traffic events, read [ARCHITECTURE_AND_BACKEND.md](./ARCHITECTURE_AND_BACKEND.md) §9 and validate read models per [READ_MODEL_ROLLOUT.md](./READ_MODEL_ROLLOUT.md).

## Verification checklist

- Add/remove/clear cart, then hard refresh immediately.
- Add/remove wishlist, then hard refresh immediately.
- Confirm changes appear across two logged-in sessions.
- Confirm admin/order badge updates do not trigger redundant bursts.
- Open a product on a vendor storefront, go back — scroll position and category tab are restored.
- After EdgeOne deploy, an open tab reloads once; `/version.json` shows a new `buildId`.
- Review CloudBase/Tencent usage dashboard after repetitive workflow testing.
